00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.210
Before moving onto the main program,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.650
you should take some time to set up

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.970
your development environment and fill in any gaps you might have with Python.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.470
We'll be making heavy use of NumPy, matplotlib,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.560
and pandas, libraries that are staples of the Python data toolkit.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.965
If you haven't worked with these before,

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:19.950
I suggest taking our intro to Data Analysis Course.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.440
Anaconda is a popular package in environment manager built specifically for data science.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.540
It's the easiest way to install and

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.580
manage all the libraries you'll need for this program.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.481
And finally, a lot of the work here will be done using Jupyter notebooks.

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:37.140
Notebooks or documents that live in your browser,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.295
it combine text, code,

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:40.590
and images all in one place.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.660
These are by far my favorite tool when working on Data Projects.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.000
And you should take time to learn how to use them effectively.
