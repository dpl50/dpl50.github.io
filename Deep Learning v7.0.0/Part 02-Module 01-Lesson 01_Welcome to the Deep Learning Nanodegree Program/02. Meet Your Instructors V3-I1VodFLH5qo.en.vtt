00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
Over the next few months Matt,

00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:04.974
Luis and I will be your primary instructors.

00:00:04.974 --> 00:00:06.429
There will also, occasionally,

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:10.230
be some other experts who come in to teach topics that they specialize in.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.720
A little bit about me.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.339
I've been a teacher for a while,

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:15.300
having started teaching programming when I was

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.210
completing my Masters in Electrical Engineering at Stanford.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.320
I focused on learning about medical systems and first

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.410
got into deep learning as a tool for medical diagnostics.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.420
I'm happiest when I'm creating and learning,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.730
and so I'm also very into deep learning as it's used in artistic applications

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.020
like learning to imitate the style of an artist

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.675
or to generate new kinds of images entirely.

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:37.174
I'm a former physicist,

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:41.034
former neuroscientist and a current huge fan of all things data.

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:45.439
I've been working with Python and data in general for the past nine years.

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:47.009
During my PhD work,

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:50.640
I used machine learning models to classify electrical signals from neurons.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.710
I have also created a few Python data science libraries,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.350
a Bayesian data analysis package called Sample,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.395
and SQL, SQL for data analysts.

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:03.920
I'm fascinated by deep learning because automation is the future,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.135
and deep learning is the future of automation.

00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:11.015
I'm a pure mathematician and a former Google engineer.

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:14.805
During my PhD, I worked an algebraic combinatorics,

00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:18.285
a field in which theoretical mathematics and applied probability meet.

00:01:18.284 --> 00:01:22.469
I then spent some years in academia working on research and teaching at university.

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.709
This is where I fell in love with machine learning and I

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.839
decided to switch to Google where I worked in

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.640
the team that uses machine learning algorithms to generate YouTube video recommendations.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.265
I, too, find deep learning fascinating as it combines

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:37.390
theoretical beauty with powerful applications
