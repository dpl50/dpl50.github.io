00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.525
Welcome to the Deep Learning Nanodegree program.

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:09.554
I'm Cezanne Camacho, the Curriculum Lead for this program.

00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:11.879
I'm excited to teach you all about the math and

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.040
programming concepts behind deep learning applications.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.809
Deep learning has made many tasks possible,

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:21.125
from language translation and self-driving car navigation,

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:22.925
to image and art generation.

00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:25.925
Deep learning is used today to learn from existing data,

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.690
notice patterns, and predict future trends.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.755
It's an active area of research, and at Udacity,

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:34.310
we've developed this program so that you'll learn about some

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.115
of the latest deep learning models and frameworks.

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:40.065
Deep learning is changing a number of industries.

00:00:40.064 --> 00:00:42.530
No matter what application you're interested in,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.899
being able to program and think critically about

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.030
deep learning models will be a valuable skill to have.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.835
It's important to always be learning,

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:52.079
and I can't wait to see where this journey takes you.
