00:00:00.114 --> 00:00:02.279
Imagine you work
for a production company,

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:06.150
and your job is to design
the characters in a movie.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.850
You would usually draw a
bunch of different concepts

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.459
before arriving at
the final design.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.120
What if you had a neural network
that could do this for you?

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.339
Maybe the lead character
needs to be "gritty."

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:22.190
No-- what about "above the law"?

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.580
That's better.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.759
How about "above the law scifi"?

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000
Yeah, that's the one.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.199
You'll build a generative
adversarial network

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.909
that's not far off.

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:35.219
In this project,
you'll build a GAN

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.259
that will generate new faces
using celebrity images.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:40.939
Have fun!
