00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
So here is the ROC curve for our carcinoma classifier.

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:08.084
In medicine, often we show the entire curve.

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:09.660
You know them as ROC curve,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.689
the sensitivity specificity curve.

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:15.379
And I'm going to have a quiz for you on which you should be able to answer.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.490
Suppose we made a neuron network that completely

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:20.264
ignored the image and randomly split out the number between zero and one,

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:22.545
and we draw the same curve for that.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:27.080
Which of the three shapes would best characterize the output of the network?
