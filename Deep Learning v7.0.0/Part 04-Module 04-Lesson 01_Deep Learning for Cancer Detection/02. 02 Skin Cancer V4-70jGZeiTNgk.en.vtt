00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.264
So, let's dive in. To set the stage on,

00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:08.250
skin cancer is the most common cancer in the world.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.974
It's not the most deadly but the most common.

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:15.460
In the U.S., we find 5.4 million new cases of skin cancer every year.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.370
They come in different types.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.510
Some are called Carcinomas,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.995
some are called Melanomas.

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:23.880
Melanomas are the ones that typically kill people, it's called the black cancer.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:26.879
Twenty percent of Americans will eventually get skin cancer.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.759
In most cases, benign cancer.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.070
Pre-cancer also cause a Actinic Keratosis,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.030
affects 58 million Americans and many more in the world.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.859
We have, in this country,

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.729
76,000 Melanomas each year and 10,000 deaths.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.034
To put this in perspective,

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:48.394
traffic accidents in this country are 40,000, so,

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:53.870
you are about four times as likely to die in a traffic collision than a skin cancer.

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:59.114
The cost for United States per year is 8.1 billion in treatment and diagnostics.

00:00:59.115 --> 00:01:01.334
Before I move on, I want to do a quiz with you,

00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:04.040
and that requires some Googling.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.350
Skin cancer comes in multiple stages from stage zero to stage four.

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:12.614
What do you think the five-year survival probability is for stage four skin cancer?

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:14.039
What do you think is for stage zero?
