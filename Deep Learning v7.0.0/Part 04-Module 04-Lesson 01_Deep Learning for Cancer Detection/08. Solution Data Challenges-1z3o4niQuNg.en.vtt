00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
If you have the same intuition like me,

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.509
you check the first three points, but not the fourth one.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:06.134
But it turns out, in our data,

00:00:06.134 --> 00:00:08.730
some dermatologists had taken specific instances of

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.480
skin diseases and edit yellow markers into

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.050
the images for sizing and the neural network could have perfectly

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.679
classified that specific disease by becoming a yellow marker detector.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.814
So, finding in our data set of 130,000 images,

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:26.220
those images with yellow markers, even having the idea that might exist in there,

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.000
that took months for us to do.
