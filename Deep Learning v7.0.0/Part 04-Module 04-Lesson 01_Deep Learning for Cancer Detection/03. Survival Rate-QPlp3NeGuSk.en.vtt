00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
As you have Googled, this is probably shocking to

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.050
see how much difference is between stage zero and stage IV.

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.290
I think the curves I'm showing you here at this moment

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.628
show the difference in survival outlook for the different stages.

00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:14.274
What's even more shocking is how similar stage zero and stage IV is.

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:16.844
Look at those images here on the right side.

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:21.179
A stage zero cancer has barely penetrated the surface, but it is very visible.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.265
But a stage IV cancer has just

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:28.469
grown below the skin layer and touched the underlying tissue and vessels.

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:29.599
It hasn't even spread yet,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.545
and yet, with this kind of cancer,

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.885
which can develop in less than a year,

00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:37.949
your survival chances would be south of 20 percent.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.270
Therefore, early detection is paramount to not dying from skin cancer.
