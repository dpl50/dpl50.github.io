00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629
Here's our curve for Carcinoma.

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.849
You find that in certain regimes,

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:06.389
it's 100 percent specific,

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:08.240
100 percent sensitive, and it's

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.684
only the little blue area on the top right that I are misclassifications.

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:17.100
And there, we can now set thresholds to emphasize the detection of

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.689
cancer or the reduce the cost of false diagnosis in the lab.

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.405
Now, our very first doctor is this point over here,

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:27.441
and it's shocking to see how much fat is below or the blue curve.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.309
In fact for the same specitivity,

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:34.429
he will miss three times as many cancers as our normal program is.

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:38.094
That is quite significant, in my opinion.

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:41.609
We then decided to test even more doctors and

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.644
here's a test set of 25 dermatologists all in the same data.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.245
And what you find is,

00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:52.349
there is a whole bunch of people that are willing to send people to the lab but still

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.140
miss significant number of cancers where our evidence is effectively perfect.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.939
What's also shocking about the result to me,

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:01.585
personally, is the spread.

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:04.500
There are some that are aggressively sending

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.234
skin samples to the lab and have a good chance of finding your cancers,

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:12.614
and others probably laugh by the endurances who don't send few of the samples to the lab,

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:15.307
and therefore, reduce diagnostic costs.

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:18.575
Who knows? But you can see from this diagram,

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:21.150
whether your personal skin cancer's detected,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.760
depends a lot on which doctor you choose.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.859
And since this kind of data is never made public,

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.239
we don't even know which doctor are more specific,

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:31.439
measure more sensitive to cancer.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.939
They appear the safer melanomas, the more important class,

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.814
and yet the results are left with a conventional image.

00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:41.724
On the right side, results taken with a special instrument called a dormoscope,

00:01:41.724 --> 00:01:45.824
and you can see again the enormous spread in all these cases,

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:49.150
the green dot is the mean of all the doctors.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.640
So, we went to all doctors and took the mean vote by the doctors.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.775
You would, in all cases,

00:01:54.775 --> 00:02:00.000
feel significantly worse than if a neural network looks at your skin.
