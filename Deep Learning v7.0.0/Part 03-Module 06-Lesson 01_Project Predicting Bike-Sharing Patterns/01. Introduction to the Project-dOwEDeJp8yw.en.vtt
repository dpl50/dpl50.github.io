00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
For the first project you'll build a

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.600
neural network to predict bike-sharing

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.330
rides. Imagine yourself owning a bike sharing

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.790
company like Cycle Hop. You want to

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.920
protect how many bikes you need because

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.750
if you have too few you're losing money

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.120
from potential riders. If you have too

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.250
many you're wasting money on bikes that

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.490
are just sitting around. So you need to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.769
predict from historical data how many

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.779
bikes you'll need in the near future. A

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.609
good way to do this is with a neural

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.380
network which is exactly what you'll do.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.869
In this notebook, you'll implement a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.250
neural network and train it on

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.780
historical data to make predictions.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.890
First, load and prepare the data. We

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.300
provided the code to prepare the data

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.280
but you'll be learning how to do all

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.469
this in a future lesson. So feel free to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.300
read it over but you'll just need to run

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.320
through the code.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.539
This is where you'll build your network.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.700
We provided some of the code for the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.770
network but you'll be implementing most

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.469
of it. And down here is where you'll

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.300
train the network and view its

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.430
performance as it's being trained.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.410
Finally you'll compare your networks

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.420
predictions with actual data. If you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.979
build your network right you should find

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.570
the network does a really good job, for

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.180
the most part. Right! It's time for you to get

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.320
started on your project.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.650
Good luck!
