00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.480
By now, you should have built
a small neural network using NumPy.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.780
However, deep learning networks can have
hundreds or thousands of hidden layers.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.689
Clearly, NumPy is not up to the task.

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:14.080
Instead we'll be using
TensorFlow to build and

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.140
train deep learning models
in the rest of this course.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.350
If you haven't heard of it,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.940
TensorFlow is a neural network
library developed by Google Brain.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.620
But before you get into TensorFlow

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.050
we've built a lesson to help you
learn about differentiable graphs.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.240
The fundamental abstraction TensorFlow
uses to run and train networks.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.560
You'll build a small library called
Miniflow that will be your very own

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.600
version of TensorFlow.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.899
Along the way, you'll gain an
understanding of differentiable graphs

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.429
as well as backpropagation.
