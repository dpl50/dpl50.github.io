Imagine you worked for a production company and

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.490
your job is to write a script for one of their television shows.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.260
You could write the script manually or you could just have a computer do it for you.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.015
In the third project, we will generate a TV script using a recurrent neural network.

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:18.250
We will train the network on existing scripts

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.290
then use it to generate an original piece of writing.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.000
Good luck and happy scripting.
