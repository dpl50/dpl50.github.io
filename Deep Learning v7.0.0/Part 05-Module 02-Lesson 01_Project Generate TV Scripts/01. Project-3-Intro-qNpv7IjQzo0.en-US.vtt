Imagine you work for a production company,

00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:06.200
and your job is to write a script 
for one of their television shows.

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:08.333
You could write the script manually or

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.100
you could just have a computer do it for you.

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:15.633
In the third project, you'll generate a TV script 
using a recurrent neural network.

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.100
You'll train the network on existing scripts,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.900
then use it to generate an original piece of writing.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.467
Good luck and happy scripting.
