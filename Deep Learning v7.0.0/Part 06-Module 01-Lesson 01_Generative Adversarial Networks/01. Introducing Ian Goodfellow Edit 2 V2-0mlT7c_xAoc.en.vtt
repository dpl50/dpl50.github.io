Hi everyone. We have a very special instructor joining us today, Ian Goodfellow.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.655
Ian is the inventor of Generative Adversarial Networks,

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:11.809
a major advancement in deep learning. Thanks for joining us Ian.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.429
Thanks, Matt. I'm really excited to get to teach

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.920
you all about Generative Adversarial Nets at Udacity.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.995
I've spent a lot of time teaching deep learning before,

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:20.525
as a TA at Stanford,

00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:22.039
as a textbook coauthor,

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.644
and on the steering committee of a journal called Distill.

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:28.515
So I'm going to teach you about Generative Adversarial Nets also called GANs.

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:31.380
There are machine learning model that can imagine new things.

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:33.969
If you give them a training set of something like images,

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.763
they can make entirely new images that are realistic,

00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:39.135
even though they've never been seen before.

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:43.929
All right. So, let's get started. Cheers.
