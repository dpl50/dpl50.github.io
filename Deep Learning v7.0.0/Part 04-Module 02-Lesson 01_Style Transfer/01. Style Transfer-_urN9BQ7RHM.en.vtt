00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
You've seen that CNN's or some of

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.945
the most powerful networks for image classification and analysis.

00:00:05.945 --> 00:00:09.839
CNN's process visual information in a feed forward manner,

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:11.969
passing an input image through a collection of

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.655
image filters which extract certain features from the input image.

00:00:15.654 --> 00:00:18.554
It turns out that these feature level representations

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:20.934
are not only useful for classification,

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:23.119
but for image construction as well.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.005
These representations are the basis for applications like Style Transfer and Deep Dream.

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:33.019
Which compose images based on CNN layer activations and extracted features.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.310
In this lesson we'll focus on learning about

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.775
and implementing the style transfer algorithm.

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:40.310
Style transfer allows you to apply the style of

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.850
one image to another image of your choice.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.770
For example, here we've applied the style of Hokusai,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.675
The Great Wave [inaudible] print to a picture of a cat.

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:50.479
The key to this technique is using

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.104
a trained CNN to separate the content from the style of an image.

00:00:54.104 --> 00:00:56.809
If you can do this then you can merge the content of

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.810
one image with the style of another and create something entirely different.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.440
Next, we'll talk about how style and content

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.140
can be separated and by the end of this lesson,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.640
you'll have all the knowledge you need to generate a stylized image of your own design.
