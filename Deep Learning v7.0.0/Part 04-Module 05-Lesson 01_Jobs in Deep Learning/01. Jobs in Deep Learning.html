         <p>
          Deep learning and related fields in AI are so fast-moving. Find opportunities by staying on top of new developments and taking note of improvements on existing architectures. Many employers value people who can think critically about what works and what doesn’t in data sources and deep learning techniques, so the more you read and try out different formulations on your own, the better! You’re also encouraged to keep track of your learning via a shared blog or personal GitHub.
         </p>
         <p>
          We recommend a 4-part strategy to finding opportunities in deep learning.
         </p>
         <ol>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Stay updated on thought leadership.
           </strong>
           Start every morning reading a 10-minute blog post on
           <a href="https://medium.com/tag/deep-learning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
            Medium
           </a>
           or by scrolling your Twitter feed. You can find an extensive list of the machine learning community on Twitter in this
           <a href="https://blog.udacity.com/2018/09/machine-learning-ai-experts-on-twitter.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
            blog post
           </a>
           . Authors tend to link to larger research papers for further insights and learnings.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            See how deep learning fits into common image analysis and machine learning roles
           </strong>
           , ranging from machine learning engineer to data analyst to software engineer. Do job searches based on skills (such as natural language processing, bayesian statistics, and convolutional neural networks) and keywords (such as artificial intelligence, and ML frameworks), rather than job title. You will find more opportunities that are a fit for your skills and interests.
          </li>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Create your own deep learning application and share it!
           </strong>
           Job seekers ask Udacity Careers all the time on how to talk about their skills and experiences - better than talking is showing. Develop your own app or product (it can be a small, personal project!), put the work online (ie: upload your code on GitHub), and then write a blog post documenting the development process and purpose of the project. You can pursue both software and hardware projects. Implementing deep learning papers is one of the best ways to show off your skills and continue learning.

           <strong>
            Read a recent paper and write about your interpretation.
           </strong>
           Employers often want to see that students are up-to-date with the latest research. So, if you’ve read a recent paper and thought critically about how it can be explained in plain language or implemented in code, then you can demonstrate your understanding by writing about it! Communication skills are valuable in this growing field; writing understandable blog posts and showing your work as you learn about deep learning will make you more visible to employers and the deep learning community at large.

          In the Deep Learning Nanodegree program, you will gain insights into and practice these core deep learning skills:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Building and training neural networks
          </li>
          <li>
           Model evaluation and validation
          </li>
          <li>
           Convolutional neural networks
          </li>
          <li>
           Autoencoders and feature extraction
          </li>
          <li>
           Transfer learning
          </li>
          <li>
           Recurrent neural networks
          </li>
          <li>
           Natural language processing
          </li>
          <li>
           Data augmentation
          </li>
          <li>
           Generative adversarial networks
          </li>
          <li>
           Hyperparameter tuning
          </li>
          <li>
           Model deployment and serving
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          To become a better job candidate, dive deeper into the following concepts, beyond the Nanodegree program. A few more ideas include:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Exploring domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and/or deep reinforcement learning through our other School of AI Nanodegree programs or other resources
          </li>
          <li>
           Advancing your programming competency in C++  (a useful language for working with hardware)
          </li>
          <li>
           Learning how to build networks in both PyTorch and TensorFlow
          </li>
          <li>
           Working with SQL and applying data analysis skills, specifically, how can you clean data or work with very small or large datasets
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Although the above is by no means an exhaustive list, taking the time to pick up any of these these technologies will only strengthen your chances of moving forward in an application process.

         <h2 id="3-could-i-apply-for-deep-learning-jobs">
          3. Could I apply for deep learning jobs?
         </h2>
         <p>
          Companies investing in cutting-edge technologies often look for candidates with deep learning knowledge. For example,
          <a href="http://athelas.com/technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
           Athelas
          </a>
          uses deep learning to count white blood cells. Companies like Spotify, Twitter, and more use machine learning skills to improve their recommendation engines. Deep learning is being used more and more often as a skill in traditional data analysis roles.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is a lack of engineers who can both build deep learning models and deploy those models to production. By completing the projects in this Nanodegree program, you’ll have all the necessary skills to find jobs anywhere in industry.

         <p>
          <em>
           Tip
          </em>
          : Remember that there are so many roles available related in deep learning. Instead of searching for job titles, consider finding top AI startups and companies and looking at their overall jobs page.
         </p>
         <p>
          Many companies, when advertising for roles requiring deep learning skills, use substitute terms. You may find these terms in job postings, rather than "deep learning" itself. Remember to read the job listing carefully. You’ll often see job titles with AI or artificial intelligence, which really means deep learning.

          Here are
          <strong>
           common titles
          </strong>
          of jobs in deep learning:

         <p>
          Although you will find jobs, especially in Silicon Valley, labelled "deep learning engineer", you are most likely to find other roles (such as "applied researcher" or "data scientist") that ask for deep learning skills. Do
