00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Here's my solution for preprocessing the training image data.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.130
I know that I want the training images and the images from my generator to be comparable,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.700
and I know my generator creates images with pixels in a range from negative one to

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.734
one due to a tanh activation function applied to its outputs.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:20.515
So here, I'm re-scaling a real training input image x into that range as well,

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:25.245
and here I'm assuming that the input x is already in a normalized range from zero to one.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:29.969
In this first line, I'm getting a maximum and minimum from my feature range and

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:32.129
the first thing I want to do is to multiply my

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.205
current zero to one range by a new range that I want.

00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:37.754
In this case, one minus negative one.

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:41.130
The max minus the min is going to give us a range of two values.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.040
So this will get me from my original zero to one to a new range zero to two and finally,

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.155
I shift that zero to two range using plus min or plus negative one in this case.

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:53.840
The shifts are ranged to be negative one to one,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.385
which is exactly what I want.

00:00:55.384 --> 00:00:57.849
Then I'm just returning the scaled x.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.340
In the cell below, I'm printing out the new min and max values for

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.909
our sample image and I can see that the new min is a negative value,

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.454
close to negative one in fact.

00:01:06.454 --> 00:01:08.179
So this looks pretty good,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.140
and above you could have just multiplied by two and subtracted one like we did last

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.805
time but I just want to show you

00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:16.700
a more general way of preprocessing this kind of pixel data.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.950
Next, I'll introduce your main task,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.000
which will be defining generator and discriminator models.
